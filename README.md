# Objective:

    Using SWAPI.co, build a React/Redux app that lists the spaceships from the Star Wars series.

#### Saturday, 20th of July

To-do:

- [x] display ships name, model, manufacturer
  - [x] starships list component?
- [] paginate with basic next/prev

#### Friday, 19th of July

- [x] install necessary starting packages
- [x] set up redux boilerplate
- [x] get initial starships data

---

Features:

- [x] Each line should display the ship's name, model and manufacturer
- [] The list is paginated with basic next/prev buttons
- [] After every 8th spaceship, insert the name of a character from Star Wars (don't repeat names)

Requirements:

- [x] ES6
- [] All data and state stored in Redux
- [] Tested (any test framework)
- [x] Fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- [] (React Router) Clicking the name of the ship brings you to a new page with more information on the ship
- [x] A basic 'loading' state/indicator when making api calls

Bonus Points:

- [] Basic styling via Emotion CSS (inline)
- [] SSR
- [] Pagination is handled via scrolling
- [] Use only functional components and React "hooks" for lifecycle features

Submitting:

- [x] Push your app to a public or private GitHub repo (if private, search and add users BrantWladichuk and darcyrailip)
- [] Don't be afraid to add emojis to your commits ;)
