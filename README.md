# Objective:

    Using SWAPI.co, build a React/Redux app that lists the spaceships from the Star Wars series.

#### Saturday, 20th of July

To-do:

- [] display ships name, model, manufacturer
  - [] starships list component?
- [] paginate with basic next/prev

#### Friday, 19th of July

- [x] install necessary starting packages
- [x] set up redux boilerplate
- [x] get initial starships data

---

Features:

- Each line should display the ship's name, model and manufacturer
- The list is paginated with basic next/prev buttons
- After every 8th spaceship, insert the name of a character from Star Wars (don't repeat names)

Requirements:

- ES6
- All data and state stored in Redux
- Tested (any test framework)
- Fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- (React Router) Clicking the name of the ship brings you to a new page with more information on the ship
- A basic 'loading' state/indicator when making api calls

Bonus Points:

- Basic styling via Emotion CSS (inline)
- SSR
- Pagination is handled via scrolling
- Use only functional components and React "hooks" for lifecycle features

Submitting:

- Push your app to a public or private GitHub repo (if private, search and add users BrantWladichuk and darcyrailip)
- Don't be afraid to add emojis to your commits ;)
